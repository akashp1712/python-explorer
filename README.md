# [Python List Explorer](https://akashp1712.github.io/python-explorer/)
* I am inspired by Sarah Drasner's [Javascript Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer) and ported it to Python.
* To quote Sarah, "please keep in mind that this is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for full documentation".

## Notes:
  * Syntax highlighted with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
  * Feel free to use the project code for your own awesome explorer.
